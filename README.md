## MojaKwaMoja Monorepo

Moja kwa Moja is swahili meaning directly.
The main concept behind the protocol would be to enable direct transfer
of donations to beneficiaries. 

Donors require charity organizations to do constant audits before
subsequent fundings and prove beneficiriaes were recepients of donation.
We demonstrate how transfers can be approved by beneficiaries with no 
digital devices at a vendors store.

Donors can make donations to verified vendor stores. Beneficiaries visit
the store to acquire goods and the fund transfer is made using AI voice
recognition to verify beneficiary. On successful verification funds are 
then transfered to the vendor.
