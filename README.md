## MojaKwaMoja Monorepo

Moja kwa Moja is swahili meaning directly.
The main concept behind the protocol would be to enable direct transfer
of donations to beneficiaries.

Moja kwa Moja attempts to solve 2 problems
- Beneficiary authenticity
Do beneficiary exists and are funds used for the primary reason beneficiary
was onboarded?

- Proof of funds transfer to beneficiaries
Record of utilization of funds directly by beneficiary.
We get an added advantage of removing middlemen in the flow of funds increasing funds available for beneficiaries.

Donors require charity organizations to do constant audits before
subsequent fundings and prove beneficiriaes were recepients of donation.
We demonstrate how transfers can be approved by beneficiaries with no
digital devices at a vendors store.

Donors can make donations to verified vendor stores. Beneficiaries visit
the store to acquire goods and the fund transfer is made using AI voice
recognition to verify beneficiary. On successful verification funds are
then transfered to the vendor.
